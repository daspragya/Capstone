# Blockchain Syllabus

Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that securely records transactions across a network of computers, ensuring transparency and immutability. Each transaction, or "block," is cryptographically linked to the previous one, forming a "chain" that is secure and tamper-resistant. Originally developed for Bitcoin, blockchain technology enables trust without intermediaries, as all participants in the network hold identical copies of the ledger. This makes blockchain applicable beyond cryptocurrencies, including in finance, supply chain management, healthcare, and more, as it offers a way to verify and audit digital transactions efficiently. The technology is transformative, promising greater transparency, security, and accountability.
