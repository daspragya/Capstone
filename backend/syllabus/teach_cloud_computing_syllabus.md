# Cloud Computing Syllabus

Cloud computing is a technology that allows individuals and organizations to access and store data, applications, and resources over the internet instead of on local servers or personal computers. It provides on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, such as servers, storage, databases, and software, which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. This technology enables scalability, cost efficiency, and flexibility, as users only pay for what they use. Cloud computing is widely used for data storage, processing, collaboration, and application hosting, supporting industries across diverse sectors, from finance to healthcare.
